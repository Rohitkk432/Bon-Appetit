## How to use?
1. Login using BITS Mail.<br />
2. You can search and choose the restaurant (currently 5 restaurants available).<br />
3. After that one will be introduced to restaurants menu divided by category which can be choosed from left tab.<br />
4. After choosing category dishes are seperated under subcategories.<br />
5. One can choose dish that they want to order by tapping on "+" and choosing customizations and adding it to cart.<br />
6. Your orders list will be visible on right side tab in Desktop view.<br />
------Further steps not implemented yet------<br />
7. And after choosing all dishes one desired he can click on checkout button in right tab or go to orders tab using nav bar.<br />
8. And place the order (order would be accepted, cooked,  dispatched and delivered by specific time hardcoded as dummy delivery).<br />

## Current Implementations
1. Login using Google Integrated Login.
2. Searching restaurants and navigating to dishes.
3. Choosing customizations and adding to cart.
4. Displaying orders on rightside tab.

## Pending Implementations
2. Confirming order on orders page and delivery.
3. Mobile view.

## Future Implementations
1. Widening search to dishes rather than just restaurants , and upon clicking it directly navigating to that dish in its restaurant page.
2. Using map to show better delivery status if used in real world app not dummy.


## Things Learned
1. Learned React-Redux tried to fetch all data tables only once at start , store it in redux-states and filter it in frontend.
2. Came to conclusion that react-redux is good but has too much boilerplate if used extensively and there is a delay if reloaded a page and it results in crashing or page.
3. Used PostgreSQL here which i was well aquainted with but wanted to try something new so tried using MERNG (graphql with MERN) with a project started from scratch which can be found here -- https://github.com/Rohitkk432/Itadakimasu.git 

## Things Played around with
1. Tried using react-redux with thunk (for async requests) for fetching all tables on login.
